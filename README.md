## üí´ About Me:

Hello! I‚Äôm **Kartik Sharma**, a passionate 15-year-old programmer from **Lucknow, India**. Currently, I‚Äôm a 9th-grade student at **Delhi Public School**. My journey in the world of technology started early, and over the years, I‚Äôve immersed myself in learning and mastering various programming languages, tools, and technologies.

Welcome to my digital playground, where technology meets creativity!

- üî≠ **Working on:** Jarvis AI Assistant ‚Äì a project that combines my love for Artificial Intelligence and software development. This AI Assistant is designed to help with various tasks and make daily life a little easier.

- üå± **Learning:** I‚Äôm constantly expanding my knowledge and skills. Right now, I‚Äôm focusing on Python, Web Development, and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). These areas are crucial for the development of efficient, powerful software solutions.

- üí¨ **Ask Me About:** Artificial Intelligence ‚Äì It‚Äôs one of my favorite subjects, and I‚Äôm always excited to discuss and explore its endless possibilities.

I embarked on my coding journey three years ago, driven by a passion for exploring the limitless possibilities within web development, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. Over time, I‚Äôve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python‚Äîeach language unlocking new dimensions of what I can create.

My projects reflect this diverse skill set. I‚Äôve built intricate web clones that replicate popular platforms, offering a deep dive into modern UI/UX design and the underlying mechanics that power these websites. Additionally, I've developed an AI assistant capable of real-time interactions, blending machine learning and natural language processing to create a responsive and intuitive digital companion.

What excites me most about technology is the fusion of creativity and logic. I love turning imaginative ideas into tangible products, whether it's designing a sleek user interface or solving complex algorithms. Every project is a new challenge, a new opportunity to learn and push the boundaries of what's possible.

As I continue to grow as a developer, I am eager to tackle even more ambitious projects, always with an eye toward innovation and excellence. Join me on this journey as I explore the ever-evolving landscape of technology, one line of code at a time.
